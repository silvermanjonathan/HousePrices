This linear regression modeling project using information about houses sold in Seattle from the the last decade.

As part of my process, I used several notebooks. Here is a table of contents for these notebooks: 

* Whittle 3
    - This is the notebook that contains the process of building the linear model

* Whittle 3 Holdout
    - This is the notebook that shows the model being predicted on the holdout data set
    
* Zip Codes and Median Salaries
    - In this notebook I used external data about zip codes in Portland, including income and population info.
      I imputed the income and population when the zip codes didn't match up with the training data set. 


* Test Train Split With Polynomials - And Using Wrapper to Whittle
    - This is the notebook that shows the Root Mean Square Error getting smaller. The final model is pickled here to be used on 
      the holdout data. 

* The Holdout Data
    - This notebook contains the holdout data with code for it to have the same features as my training set. 
      My final model fitted on the holdout data. There's an array of predictions for the house price.

* Statistical Test
    - This notebook contains two-sample t-tests performed on a categorical variable known as a condition. 
      The categorical variable could have taken five values. I used five t-tests to reject or accept 
      a null hypothesis where the set of houses with a particular condition rating, had the same mean price
      as a set of houses with all the other condition ratings. The unexpected statistical conclusion rejected
      the null hypothesis for condition rating number three. 

* Dummy Creation
    - This notebook contains code for making dummy variables.

* Filter Variables on Correlation Coefficient
    - This notebook uses a visual approach to identifyl multi-collinearity amongst the numerous independant variables
    in the starting data set before any polynomial interactives feature engineering. It in fact didn't impact the model.

* Part 4.4,  4.5
    - This notebook I created an interactive feature manually that increased the percentage of data predicted.
    This interactive feature eneded up being kept and created automatically anyway by Sci-Kit learn.

* Step 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
    - This notebook is an example of feature re-engineering to turn features that have a year as a value
    into a number of years away from the present.

* Step 2 Exploratory Data Analysis
    - This notebook contains scatter plots of the dependant variables.
